 A letter to myself.
Dear Bingrui in the future,

As you read this, I take it you were shuffling around some old files lately and came upon this.

I hope by the time you read this, you will have already got into the AMC10 2.5% and the AIME.I really hope that in the future you will go to Harvard. But this dream won't come true unless both you and I work together to get there. I promise that from now on I will do my fair share of the work to get there, and you promise to do yours.It's going to be had, and in my life I finally realized I haven't actually worked hard to accomplish a goal before. Right now, I have to work hard, back-breaking, tireless hours and lots of sacrifice to pave way for you to do your part. In actuallity, I'm lost at what to do right now, but I see my goal and I'll have to sacrifice whatever it takes to do it.In the end, human life is too short and too fast, my childhood dream was to do this, and we need to control and push ourselves.

Much Thanks,
Your past 7th Grade self
